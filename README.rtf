 For my capstone I chose to create a task manager app that implements some of googles material design guidelines. In this app I was able to learn a lot of new things pertaining to Android development but a lot of methods I used in my app were similar to things we learned throughout the school year. For example when I click on a button instead of using an on click listener like we used in class I used a button add click. I used an array list for the tasks in my app as well.\
